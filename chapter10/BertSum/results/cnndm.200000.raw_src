[CLS] about 4 ##. ##45 billion years ago , 150 million years after the solar system formed , earth was hit by a mars ##- ##si ##ze object called the ##ia . [SEP] [CLS] the collision created the moon , but debate has raged exactly what happened during this event - and a mystery has persisted on why the moon and earth are so similar in their composition . [SEP] [CLS] now , conflicting studies have provided two different theories - one that the ##ia was similar to earth , and another that earth and the moon were showered by debris following the collision . [SEP] [CLS] three studies have provided different theories for what happened after earth was struck by a mars ##- ##si ##zed object called the ##ia , 4 ##. ##45 billion years ago . [SEP] [CLS] what is agreed on , though , is that the impact actually happened ( artist ' ##s illustration shown ) . [SEP] [CLS] this is known as the giant impact hypothesis [SEP] [CLS] the two theories appear in the journal nature across three studies - two in favour of the ` similar to earth ' theory , and the other favour ##ing the ` shower of debris ' model . [SEP] [CLS] in the latter theory , a team of scientists at the university of maryland said the impact of the ##ia with earth was so violent , the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon . [SEP] [CLS] many researchers believe the moon formed after earth was hit by a planet the size of mars billions of years ago . [SEP] [CLS] this is called the giant impact hypothesis . [SEP] [CLS] the hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4 ##. ##5 billion years ago . [SEP] [CLS] the col ##lid ##ing body is sometimes called the ##ia , after the mythical greek titan who was the mother of se ##lene , the goddess of the moon . [SEP] [CLS] but one mystery has persisted , revealed by rocks the apollo astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and earth so similar in their composition ? [SEP] [CLS] several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of earth and the moon . [SEP] [CLS] perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the earth and then later condensed to form the moon . [SEP] [CLS] or the ##ia could have , coincidentally , been iso ##top ##ically similar to young earth . [SEP] [CLS] a third possibility is that the moon formed from earth ##en materials , rather than from the ##ia , although this would have been a very unusual type of impact . [SEP] [CLS] this cloud would have been composed of some earth material , explaining the similarity between earth and the moon
